OpenAI response for Prompt: using artificial intelligence write a program for writing prime numbers in Python 
 ************************ 
 


#This code is written in Python 3

#defining a function that takes user input n
def primenum(n):
  
 #setting a variable to take true to enter the loop
  flag  = True
 
 #loop that loops from 2 to n - 1 as any number is divisible by itself and 1 
  for i in range(2, n):

 #checking if the entered number is divisible by other numbers 
    if n  % i  == 0:
        flag = False
        break

#returning flag
  return flag

#Taking a number from the user
 num = int(input("Enter any number:"))

#function call
 if primenum(num):
   print (num,"is a prime number")
 else:
   print (num,"is not a prime number")
